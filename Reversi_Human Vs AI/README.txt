in the project, we merged our projects in the sequense classes:
from the first program:
- input check
- some functions of cell
- the interface of logic, and seperating the logic and the human logic
- the vector of cells
- some functions of board

from the second program: 
- the logic of the game
- game flow class
- game class


in addition, we aaded together the sequense classes:
- the logic of the computer
- seperating the human logic and the computer logic
- adding function playMove int the logic classes - which play the turn 
	of each kind of player - human or logic.
- adding the functions that are the same int humanLogic and comuterLogic
	, and add them to the interface Logic.
- make a menu which the player decide to play ageist human or computer.
- making a tests of the project
